abstract = {Submarine turbidity currents are controlled by gravity acting on suspended sediments that pull water downslope along with them1. In addition to suspended sediments, turbidity currents also transport sediments at the base of the flow2, which causes the reorganization of basal sediments prior to the settling of suspended grains3, 4, 5, 6. However, as turbidity currents reach areas with minimal slope, they cross a fall-velocity threshold beyond which the suspended sediments begin to stratify the flow. This process extinguishes the turbulence near the bed7, 8. Here we use direct numerical simulation of turbidity currents to show that this extinction of turbulence eliminates the ability of the flow to re- entrain sediment and rework the sediment at the base of the flow. Our simulations indicate that deposits from flows without basal reworking should lack internal structures such as laminations. Under appropriate conditions, then, sustained delivery of fine sediments will therefore result in the emplacement of massive turbidites. We suggest that this mechanism can explain field observations of massive deposits9 that were emplaced gradually by dilute but powerful turbidity currents. We also conclude that turbulence in submarine turbidity currents is more fragile than river systems, and more sensitive to damping by the stratification of suspended sediment in the flow.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with an analysis of the near-tip region of a fluid-driven fracture propagating in a permeable saturated rock. It focuses on the calculation of the pore fluid pressure in the tip cavity, the region corresponding to the lag between the front of the fracturing fluid and the fracture tip. In contrast to impermeable rocks where the tip cavity can be considered to be at zero pressure, the fluid pressure in the tip cavity is here unknown and not uniform as exchange of pore fluid between the cavity and the porous medium and flow of pore fluid within the cavity is taking place. Solution of the fluid pressure in the tip region requires therefore simultaneous consideration of fracture mechanics (for the aperture of the tip cavity), diffusion theory for the movement of fluid within the porous medium, and viscous flow along the crack. Construction of such a solution within the framework of some simplifying assumptions is the main objective of this paper. It is shown that the problem depends, in general, upon two numbers with the meaning of a permeability and a propagation velocity. For the asymptotic case of large propagation speed, these two numbers merge into a single parameter, while the solution becomes independent of the propagation velocity in the limit of small velocity. The particular case of large velocity is solved analytically, while both the general and the small velocity cases are computed numerically but with different techniques. The paper concludes with a comprehensive analysis of numerical results.},

abstract = {Turbidity currents are large sediment-carrying submarine avalanches that flow over the continental slope and through submarine channels to the deeps of the world's oceans. For more than 50 years researchers have extended the hydrostatic pressure simplification, which is valid in most hydraulic analyses of flow in rivers and channels, to analyses of turbidity currents. In this paper we present the first measurements of fluid pressure beneath experimental turbidity currents. Basal fluid pressures are much lower (30\%–45\%) than those predicted from bulk flow density, in proportion to the kinematic energy density of the flow, a parameter usually referred to as the dynamic pressure. This invalidates the commonplace assumption of a hydrostatic pressure regime in turbidity currents, and necessitates the incorporation of dynamic fluid pressure as a physical parameter in the analysis of turbidity currents. The contrast between turbidity currents and free surface flows is caused by the difference in their density structure. We highlight current enigmas and gaps in our knowledge of submarine currents, for which our result opens new opportunities of investigation. },

@article{Gadde,
abstract = {AbstractWater-fracs, consisting of proppant pumped with un-gelled fluid are the type of stimulation used in many low-permeability reservoirs throughout the United States. The use of low viscosity, Newtonian, fluids allows the creation of long narrow fractures in the reservoir without the excessive height growth often seen with cross-linked fluids. Proppant transport is a central issue in all these treatments because of the low viscosity of the fracturing fluid.New models for proppant transport and settling in hydraulic fractures were developed and implemented in a 3-d hydraulic fracturing code. It is shown that a simple Stokes settling model is grossly inadequate. The proppant settling models developed in this paper account for the effects of fracture walls, changes in settling velocities and rheology caused by changes in proppant concentration, turbulence effects due to high fluid velocities and inertial effects associated with large relative velocities between the proppant and the fluid. Narrower fractures, higher proppant concentration and smaller proppant size reduce settling whereas turbulence leads to an increase in settling. Results are presented to show how the settling velocities are impacted by fluid velocity, proppant size, fluid rheology and fracture width. In most instances settling velocities differ significantly from the Stokes settling velocity.The new proppant settling model was incorporated into a 3-D hydraulic fracture simulator (UTFRAC-3D). Simulation results show that when settling is accounted for, significantly shorter propped lengths are obtained. The narrow fractures associated with water-fracs alter settling and thereby alter the proppant placement significantly. Although increasing fluid viscosity can reduce settling rates, increased height growth reduces the distance to which proppant can be placed. This clearly suggests a need to optimize fluid rheology. The improved fracture simulator can be used to better design fracture treatments (fluid rheology, injection rates, proppant concentration and size) for better proppant placement under a given set of in-situ stress conditions.IntroductionWater-fracs are commonly applied in low permeability gas reservoirs. These treatments involve pumping low viscosity ungelled fracture fluids. The low viscosity of the slick water leads to long created fracture lengths. However, due to high settling velocities of the proppant in the low viscosity fluid, the propped lengths achieved can be very small. Modifications to the water-frac stimulation design are needed to transport proppant further out into the fracture. This requires suspending the proppant until the fracture closes without generating excessive fracture height. Proppant transport clearly is a central issue in all these treatments. An improved proppant transport model is presented that can accurately model proppant transport when either un-gelled or cross-linked fluids are used to place the proppant. The use of this proppant transport model will allow engineers to customize treatment designs for individual wells.The complete model for proppant transport in hydraulic fractures was incorporated into UTFRAC-3D, a fully three-dimensional hydraulic fracture simulator. The proppant transport equations were solved on an adaptive finite element mesh. The settling of the proppant was modeled taking into account the change in settling velocities and rheology due to changes in proppant concentration, turbulence effects due to high fluid velocities, and inertial effects associated with large relative velocities between the proppant and the fluid.Inertial effects become significant at high settling velocities (Rep>2) and are discussed in the next section. The effects of particle concentration, fracture width and turbulence are discussed in the following sections. An example calculation is shown to demonstrate the importance of each of the correlation factors applied to the Stoke's settling velocity. Finally, the settling correlations are incorporated into a proppant transport model in a fully 3-D 
fracture simulator (UTFRAC-3D). Results from the model are discussed in the last section.The project is co-funded by the US Department of Energy - National Energy Technology Laboratory.},

@article{Glowinski1999,
abstract = {A new Lagrange-multiplier based fictitious-domain method is presented for the direct numerical simulation of viscous incompressible flow with suspended solid particles. The method uses a finite-element discretization in space and an operator-splitting technique for discretization in time. The linearly constrained quadratic minimization problems which arise from this splitting are solved using conjugate-gradient algorithms. A key feature of the method is that the fluid-particle motion is treated implicitly via a combined weak formulation in which the mutual forces cancel-explicit calculation of the hydrodynamic forces and torques on the particles is not required. The fluid flow equations are enforced inside, as well as outside, the particle boundaries. The flow inside, and on, each particle boundary is constrained to be a rigid-body motion using a distributed Lagrange multiplier. This multiplier represents the additional body force per unit volume needed to maintain the rigid-body motion inside the particle boundary, and is analogous to the pressure in incompressible fluid flow, whose gradient is the force required to maintain the constraint of incompressibility. The method is validated using the sedimentation of two circular particles in a two-dimensional channel as the test problem, and is then applied to the sedimentation of 504 circular particles in a closed two-dimensional box. The resulting suspension is fairly dense, and the computation could not be carried out without an effective strategy for preventing particles from penetrating each other or the solid outer walls; in the method described herein, this is achieved by activating a repelling force on close approach, such as might occur as a consequence of roughness elements on the particle. The development of physically based mathematical methods for avoiding particle-particle and particle-wall penetration is a new problem posed by the direct simulation of fluidized suspensions. The simulation starts with the particles packed densely at the top of the sedimentation column. In the course of their fall to the bottom of the box, a fingering motion of the particles, which are heavier than the surrounding fluid, develops in a way reminiscent of the familiar dynamics associated with the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of heavy fluid above light. We also present here the results of a three-dimensional simulation of the sedimentation of two spherical particles. The simulation reproduces the familiar dynamics of drafting, kissing and tumbling to side-by-side motion with the line between centers across the flow at Reynolds numbers in the hundreds.},

This behavior is observed for a large range of materials and a master curve e/emax = f(St) is obtained.

abstract = {The motion of an individual sphere settling in the midst of a suspension of like spheres has been examined experimentally for suspensions with volume concentrations, ϕ, of 2.5-10\%, under creeping flow conditions and in the absence of Brownian motion. In the experiments, silvered glass spheres were tracked in optically transparent suspensions of glass beads. Arrival times measured at a series of horizontal planes were converted into average settling speeds. These average speeds yield the hindered settling speed as a function of concentration. The hindered settling speed, normalized by the isolated sphere settling speed, exhibits a 1 - 4ϕ + 8ϕ\^{}2 dependence for the range of concentrations investigated. The settling speed fluctuations are quite large, ranging up to 46\% of the average, and have long-time (large settling distance) behavior characteristic of a Fickian diffusion process. Dispersion coefficients have therefore been determined from the asymptotic dependence upon settling distance of the variance in settling speed. These coefficients scale with the product of the hindered settling speed and the sphere radius. The dimensionless dispersion coefficients, all O(1), increase with concentration for ϕ < 5\%, then slightly decrease at higher concentrations. Verification of the scaling through the use of two particle sizes, care taken to mix the suspensions to random, uniform initial conditions, and the robustness of the statistics over many realizations preclude the possibility of this phenomenon being an experimental artifact and support the hypothesis that hydrodynamic dispersion of suspended particles will result from viscous interactions between the particles.},

abstract = {A model for fine sediment transport processes in the fluvial and coastal environment is proposed based on a simplified two-phase formulation. This simplified approach for fine-sediment transport is essentially single-phased; however, it retains several critical mechanisms originated from the complete two-phase formulation. By incorporating closures of carrier fluid turbulence and turbulent suspension and rheology of the sediment, the model is first tested with laboratory measurements of flow velocity and concentration for fine-sand transport driven by steady currents. Next, particle diameter and density are prescribed in the model according to fractal dimensions of typical flocs for fluid mud observed on the continental shelf. The model is able to predict the dynamics of tidal-driven lutocline behavior observed on the Amazon shelf and wave-supported gravity-driven fluid mud transport measured at the Po prodelta. Model results also indicate strong interplay between flow turbulence and fluid-mud concentration, suggesting that the mechanism of sediment-induced stratification on damping the carrier fluid turbulence is crucial in determining the fluid mud behavior. Results are encouraging for incorporation in the future of more comprehensive descriptions on floc dynamics, mud-bed consolidation and various mud rheology closures.},

abstract = {Fluid particulate flows are common phenomena in nature and industry. Modeling of such flows at micro and macro levels as well establishing relationships between these approaches are needed to understand properties of the particulate matter. We propose a computational technique based on the direct numerical simulation of the particulate flows. The numerical method is based on the distributed Lagrange multiplier technique following the ideas of Glowinski et al. [16] and Patankar [30]. Each particle is explicitly resolved on an Eulerian grid as a separate domain, using solid volume fractions. The fluid equations are solved through the entire computational domain, however, Lagrange multiplier constrains are applied inside the particle domain such that the fluid within any volume associated with a solid particle moves as an incompressible rigid body. Mutual forces for the fluid-particle interactions are internal to the system. Particles interact with the fluid via fluid dynamic equations, resulting in implicit fluid-rigid body coupling relations that produce realistic fluid flow around the particles (i.e., no-slip boundary conditions). The particle-particle interactions are implemented using explicit force-displacement interactions for frictional inelastic particles similar to the DEM method of Cundall et al. [10] with some modifications using a volume of an overlapping region as an input to the contact forces. The method is flexible enough to handle arbitrary particle shapes and size distributions. A parallel implementation of the method is based on the SAMRAI (Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Application Infrastructure) library, which allows handling of large amounts of rigid particles and enables local grid refinement. Accuracy and convergence of the presented method has been tested against known solutions for a falling particle as well as by examining fluid flows through stationary particle beds (periodic and cubic packing). To evaluate code performance and validate particle contact physics algorithm, we performed simulations of a representative experiment conducted at the U.C. Berkeley Thermal Hydraulic Lab for pebble flow through a narrow opening. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although high gas flow rates from shales are a relatively recent phenomenon, the knowledge bases of shale-specific well completions, fracturing and shale well operations have actually been growing for more than three decades and shale gas production reaches back almost one hundred ninety years. During the last decade of gas shale development, projected recovery of shale gas-in-place has increased from about 2\% to estimates of about 50\%; mainly through the development and adaptation of technologies to fit shale gas developments. Adapting technologies, including multi-stage fracturing of horizontal wells, slickwater fluids with minimum viscosity and simultaneous fracturing, have evolved to increase formation-face contact of the fracture system into the range of 9.2 million m2 (100 million ft2) in a very localized area of the reservoir by opening natural fractures. These technologies have made possible development of enormous gas reserves that were completely unavailable only a few years ago. Current and next generation technologies promise even more energy availability with advances in hybrid fracs, fracture complexity, fracture flow stability and methods of re-using water used in fracturing. This work surveyed over 350 shale completion, fracturing and operations publications, linking geosciences and engineering information together to relay learnings that will identify both intriguing information on selective opening and stabilizing of micro-fracture systems within the shales and new fields of endeavor needed to achieve the next level of shale development advancement.},

abstract = {The oceans sequester carbon from the atmosphere partly as a result of biological productivity. Over much of the ocean surface, this productivity is limited by essential nutrients and we discuss whether it is likely that sequestration can be enhanced by supplying limiting nutrients. Various methods of supply have been suggested and we discuss the efficacy of each and the potential side effects that may develop as a result. Our conclusion is that these methods have the potential to enhance sequestration but that the current level of knowledge from the observations and modelling carried out to date does not provide a sound foundation on which to make clear predictions or recommendations. For ocean fertilization to become a viable option to sequester CO2, we need more extensive and targeted fieldwork and better mathematical models of ocean biogeochemical processes. Models are needed both to interpret field observations and to make reliable predictions about the side effects of large-scale fertilization. They would also be an essential tool with which to verify that sequestration has effectively taken place. There is considerable urgency to address climate change mitigation and this demands that new fieldwork plans are developed rapidly. In contrast to previous experiments, these must focus on the specific objective which is to assess the possibilities of CO2 sequestration through fertilization.},

@misc{Necker2005,
abstract = {Results are presented from a high-resolution computational study of particle-driven gravity currents in a plane channel. The investigation was conducted in order to obtain better insight into the energy budget and the mixing behaviour of such flows. Two- and three-dimensional simulations are discussed, and the effects of different factors influencing the flow are examined in detail. Among these are the aspect ratio of the initial suspension reservoir, the settling speed of the particles, and the initial level of turbulence in the suspension. While most of the study is concerned with the lock-exchange configuration, where the initial height of the suspension layer is equal to the height of the channel, part of the analysis is also done for a deeply submerged case. Here, the suspension layer is only one-tenth of the full channel height. Concerning the energy budget, a careful analysis is undertaken of dissipative losses in the flow. Dissipative losses arising from the macroscopic fluid motion are distinguished from those due to the microscopic flow around each sedimenting particle. It is found that over a large range of settling velocities and suspension reservoir aspect ratios, sedimentation accounts for roughly half of all dissipative losses. The analysis of the mixing behaviour of the flow concentrates on the mixing between interstitial and ambient fluid, which are taken to be of identical density. The former is assumed to carry a passive contaminant, whose dispersion with time is analysed qualitatively and quantitatively by means of Lagrangian markers. The simulations show the mixing between interstitial and ambient fluid to be more intense for larger values of the particle settling velocity. Finally, the question is addressed of whether or not initial turbulence in the suspension may exert a significant effect on the flow evolution. To this end, results from three simulations with widely different levels of initial kinetic energy are compared. While the initial turbulence level strongly affects the mixing within the current, it has only a small influence on the front velocity and the overall sedimentation rate. 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Quantifying the characteristics of the turbidity currents that are responsible for the erosion, lateral migration and filling of submarine channels maybe useful for predicting the distribution of lithofacies in channel fill and levee reservoirs. This paper uses data from a well-studied submarine channel in Amazon Fan in an attempt to reconstruct the velocity, thickness, concentration, duration, recurrence rates and vertical structure of turbidity currents in this long sinuous channel. Estimates of flow conditions are derived from the morphology of the channels and the characteristics of the deposits within them. In particular, the availability of information on the sediment distribution with respect to the channel topography at the time of deposition allows for insights into the vertical structure of the flow, a key property that has been so far poorly understood. Integration of flow constraints from well and seismic data or from detailed analysis of outcrop with numerical flow models is a critical step toward a complete understanding of the flow and associated deposits. Turbidity currents in sinuous submarine channels, exemplified by Amazon Channel, are found to last for tens of hours and occur on a regular, quasi-annual basis. Model results suggest that these flows had, on average, velocities ranging from 2 to 4 m/s in the canyon/upper fan which decreased to 0.5-1 m/s in the lower fan, travelling in excess of 800 km. The model turbidity currents were subcritical over most of the channel length, indicating a low degree of water entrainment and low rate of deceleration down the channel. The formation of such long, sinuous channels is intrinsically associated with frequent, long-duration, subcritical turbidity currents carrying a silt-dominated sediment load. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The present part of the experimental work has been confined to uniformly sized spherical particles, greater than 100 microns in diameter. As reported elsewhere, an attempt has been made to develop an expression, from theoretical considerations, for the rate of settling of suspensions, and the experimental results obtained in the present work are compared with those predicted from this theory.

abstract = {We propose a two-phase model having a Newtonian rheology for the fluid phase and friction for the particle phase to describe bed-load transport in the laminar viscous regime. We have applied this continuum model to sediment transport by viscous shearing flows. The equations are shown to reduce to the momentum equation for the mixture and the Brinkman equation for the fluid velocity. This modelling is able to provide a description of the flow of the mobile granular layer. At some distance from threshold of particle motion, where the continuum approach is more realistic as the mobile layer is larger than one particle diameter, there is very little slip between the two phases and the velocities inside the mobile bed have approximately a parabolic profile. When the Poiseuille (or Couette) flow is not significantly perturbed, simple analytical results of the particle flux varying cubically with the Shields number and of the bed-load thickness varying linearly with it can then be obtained. These predictions compare favourably with experimental observations of bed-load transport in pipe flows.},
